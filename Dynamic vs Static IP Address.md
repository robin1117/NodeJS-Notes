## 🌀 Dynamic IP Address

**Definition:**  
An IP address that changes periodically or after reboot.

**Assigned By:**  
Automatically provided by **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) — usually from a router or ISP.

**Stability:**  
Can change every time the device reconnects to the network or after some time.

**Cost:**  
Usually **free** with standard internet plans.

**Use Cases:**  
- Home networks  
- Personal devices  
- General internet browsing, streaming, or gaming  

**Security:**  
- More secure for normal users because it’s **harder to trace**.  

**Configuration:**  
- No manual setup required — everything happens automatically.

## 💻 Static IP Address

**Definition:**  
A fixed IP address that remains the same until manually changed.

**Assigned By:**  
Manually configured by the user or assigned by the **ISP**.

**Stability:**  
Always **remains the same** unless changed intentionally.

**Cost:**  
Usually **requires extra charges** from the ISP.

**Use Cases:**  
- Servers and website hosting  
- Remote access  
- VPN setup  
- CCTV or IoT device management  

**Security:**  
- Can be **vulnerable** if not properly secured because the address is always the same.  

**Configuration:**  
- Requires **manual setup** and technical knowledge.
