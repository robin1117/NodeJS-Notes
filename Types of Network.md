#Networking
Networks are divided based on their **size**, **range**, and **usage**.

### 🔹 1. LAN (Local Area Network)
A network created in a small geographical area such as a home, school, or office.
### 🏠 Example:
- All computers in an office connected to one router  
- A home WiFi network

Range : Few meters to a few kilometers
Use : Fast, secure, and low-cost network used for internal communication.

---
### 🔹 2. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
A city-level network that connects multiple LANs within a city.

### 🏙️ Example:
- City-wide broadband services  
- Cable TV network

### 📏 Range:
Up to **50 km (approximately)**

### ⚙️ Use:
Used for city-level communication — schools, colleges, and government offices within one city.

---
## 🔹 3. WAN (Wide Area Network)
A large-scale network that covers countries and even continents.

### 🌍 Example:
- The Internet itself  
- Bank ATM network across India
### 📏 Range:
Thousands of kilometers

### ⚙️ Use:
Used for global communication and large-scale business connectivity.

---

### 🔸 PAN (Personal Area Network)
A short-range network created around an individual person.

#### 📱 Example:
- Bluetooth devices  
- Mobile hotspot (tethering)  
- Smartwatch connecting to a phone

#### 📏 Range:
~10 meters

  
---

### 🔸 BAN (Body Area Network)
A network formed around a human body — mainly used for healthcare applications.

#### 🩺 Example:
- Heart rate monitor  
- Fitness tracker syncing to a mobile app

#### 📏 Range:
Few centimeters to a few meters


---

### 🔸 CAN (Campus Area Network)
A network covering multiple buildings within a campus such as a college, university, or company.

#### 🏫 Example:
- IIT campus network  
- Company campus with multiple connected buildings

#### 📏 Range:
Few kilometers — larger than LAN but smaller than MAN.
