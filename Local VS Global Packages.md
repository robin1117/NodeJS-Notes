**Local packages** are those that are installed in the local `node_modules` directory of your project. These packages are accessible **only within that specific project** and cannot be used globally across your system. They are commonly used when your project depends on specific versions of a package.

**Global packages**, on the other hand, are installed system-wide. These packages can be accessed from **anywhere in your system**, including different terminals like **Command Prompt**, **PowerShell**, or **Bash**. Global packages are typically used for CLI tools (like `nodemon`, `typescript`, `eslint`, etc.) that you want to run from any location.
