The Same-Origin Policy is a crucial security mechanism in web browsers. It prevents a script loaded from one origin from accessing data from a different origin. This protects sensitive information such as cookies or user data from being stolen by unauthorized sources. Two domains are considered to have the same origin only if their protocol, host, and port are all the same.

unless specific permission is granted like CORS This exchange of information between different origins requires mechanisms like Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, or CORS, to ensure the connection is safe and authorized.

## 🔐 What is Same-Origin Policy?

The **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)** is a fundamental security rule **enforced by web browsers by default**. It restricts how documents or scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.

> SOP is automatically enabled in all modern browsers. You do not need to set it manually.

## 🧾 What is an "origin"?

An **origin** is defined as:

```
Origin = Protocol + Hostname + Port
```

Any difference in **protocol**, **hostname**, or **port** makes it a different origin.

---

## ✅ What SOP Blocks

- Reading cookies, `localStorage`, or `sessionStorage` of another origin
- Reading response body from `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` to a different origin
- Accessing cross-origin iframe DOM or content

---

## ✅ What SOP Allows

- Sending requests (e.g., `fetch`, `<img src=...>`, `<script src=...>`) to other origins
- Loading styles, fonts, scripts, and images from other origins (read-only)
- Embedding cross-origin content in iframes (read-only access)

---

## 🎯 Why Was SOP Created?

To protect users from malicious websites. For example:

1. You're logged into `https://yourbank.com`.
2. You visit `https://hacker.com`, which tries to fetch data from your bank using JavaScript.
3. SOP prevents `hacker.com` from reading the response, accessing your cookies, or stealing your session.

| Who enforces SOP?    | Browser                     |
| Is SOP optional?     | ❌ No — always enabled       |
| Can you disable it?  | ❌ No — not in real browsers |
| Who does it protect? | The user and their data     |

## 🔐 Summary

- Same-Origin Policy is **enabled by default** in all browsers.
- It ensures that scripts from one origin **cannot access** sensitive data from another.
- It is one of the most important browser security mechanisms.

> SOP is a core reason why websites can't freely read your data from other tabs or cookies from unrelated domains.
