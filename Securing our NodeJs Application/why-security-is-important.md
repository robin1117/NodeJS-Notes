# Why Security Is Important in Web Applications

Security is a fundamental aspect of building modern web applications. As apps increasingly handle sensitive data (like personal information, passwords, and financial records), any security loophole can lead to data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.

## 🔐 Why Is Security Important?

1. **Protect User Data**

   * Users trust apps with private and sensitive information. Security ensures it stays protected.

2. **Prevent Unauthorized Access**

   * Strong authentication and access control mechanisms prevent attackers from gaining control over the application or user data.

3. **Ensure Business Continuity**

   * Downtime caused by attacks (e.g. DDoS) can disrupt operations and lead to revenue loss.

4. **Compliance with Laws & Standards**

   * Regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS require strong security measures.

5. **Maintain Reputation & Trust**

   * A breach can permanently damage a company’s credibility in the market.

## 🚨 Common Security Threats in Web Applications

### 1. **SQL Injection or NoSQL Injection**

* Attackers inject malicious SQL code to manipulate or access the database.
* Example: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1;`
* **Prevention**: Use parameterized queries or ORM libraries.

### 2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

* Injecting malicious scripts into webpages to hijack user sessions or steal data.
* Example: `<script>document.cookie</script>`
* **Prevention**: Sanitize user input and use frameworks that escape output.

### 3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

* Forces a user to execute unwanted actions on a web app where they’re authenticated.
* **Prevention**: Use CSRF tokens and same-site cookie attributes.

### 4. **Broken Authentication**

* Weak password policies, session hijacking, or unexpired tokens.
* **Prevention**: Use secure authentication libraries, implement 2FA, and manage session lifetimes.

### 5. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**

* Accessing unauthorized resources by manipulating input (e.g. `/user/1234 → /user/1235`).
* **Prevention**: Implement access control checks on every sensitive resource.

### 6. **Sensitive Data Exposure**

* Improper storage or transmission of confidential data.
* **Prevention**: Use HTTPS, encryption, and avoid logging sensitive info.

### 7. **Security Misconfiguration**

* Default credentials, exposed error messages, open ports, etc.
* **Prevention**: Harden servers, disable unnecessary features, and regularly audit configurations.

### 8. **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)**

* Overloading the server to make it unavailable to legitimate users.
* **Prevention**: Rate limiting, traffic filtering, and using CDNs.

### 9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**

* Including outdated libraries or packages with known security flaws.
* **Prevention**: Keep dependencies updated and scan regularly.

### 10. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**

* Attacks may go undetected without proper logging.
* **Prevention**: Implement audit logs and alerting mechanisms.
