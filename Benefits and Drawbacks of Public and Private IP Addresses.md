## 🌍 Public IP Address
### ✅ Benefits

- Accessible from **anywhere on the internet** — ideal for servers, websites, or remote access systems.  
- Uniquely identifies a device on the **global internet**.  
- Supports **direct peer‑to‑peer** communication.

### ❌ Drawbacks

- Limited availability due to **IPv4 exhaustion**.  
- More exposed to **hacking, scanning, and DDoS attacks**.  
- Often **more expensive**, since it must be assigned by the ISP.

## 🏠 Private IP Address

### ✅ Benefits

- More **secure for internal networks** (not exposed directly to the internet).  
- The same private IP ranges can be reused in different networks.  
- Helps conserve public IPs using **NAT (Network Address Translation)**.

### ❌ Drawbacks

- Not reachable from the internet directly — **not routable publicly**.  
- Requires **NAT** for communication outside the local network.  
- Can complicate tasks like hosting servers or remote access
