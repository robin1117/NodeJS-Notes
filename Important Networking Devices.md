## Important Networking Devices
  
  - host
  - repeater
  - hub
  - switch
  - router
  - bridge
  - modem
  - access-point
  - node
  
### 1. Host

**Host** is any device, such as **computer, smartphone or server**, that is connected to a network and can communicate with other devices on that network.
In short, host is a computer that connected with network, which can *consume and produce data*.

### 2. Repeater

A **repeater** is a device that amplifies or regenerate weak or degraded signals to extend the range of a network.
It receives a signal, strengthens it and then retransmits the signal.
When we try to transmit data or resource with signals in long distances the signal becomes weaker. That's why we need to use **repeater** that amplifies the signal and re-transmit it.

### 3. HUB

A *hub* is a hardware device used at the **physical layer** to connect multiple devices in the network. Its a multiport Repeater|repeater

- Hubs cannot filter data.
- It also can't identify the destination of the packet.
- Thats why it sends the data on every device which waste bandwith.
- It broadcast or sends the message to each port.

### 4. Switch

A *Switch* is a hardware device that connects multiple devices to a network, allowing them to share information and communication.

It have many ports, and when data arrives at any port, the destination address is examined first and some checks are also done and then it is processed to the device.

We can say it is more digitalized and advance version of hubs.

### 5. Router

A *router* is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.

It connects multiple networks, such as home network to the Internet, and directs data to the correct destination.

---

### 6. Bridge

A **bridge** was traditionally used to connect multiple LANs (Local Area Networks), each consisting of a router and several connected devices.

However, **bridges are rarely used today**, as modern routers and switches have become more advanced and efficient in handling this tasks.

### 7. MODEM

Modulator + Demodulator = MODEM  
A *modem* is a network device that modulates and demodulates signals.  
A modem converts between *analog signals* and *digital signals*.
The ONU/ONT connected with your router, which acts like a MODEM.

### 8. Access Point

An **Access Point (AP)** in networking is a **device that allows wireless devices (like laptops, phones, tablets)** to connect to a **wired network** using **Wi-Fi**.
An **Access Point** is like a **Wi-Fi bridge** between your wired network and your wireless devices.
- Extend network using **Ethernet** cable.

---
### 9. Node

A **node** is any **active** electronic device on a network that has a **unique address** and is capable of **communicating** over the network.
Example: switches, routers, end-devices (computer, smartphone, tablets), and any *network connected* device.
For an example a host is a *node* that can run apps, process data, and act as a source or destination.
