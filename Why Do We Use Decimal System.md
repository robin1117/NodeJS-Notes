- The main reason behind it, we as humans have 10 fingers in our hand which makes easy for us to calculate, That does not mean being entire world was using Decimal number system - These was other system exist too- 
	 Roman Number system .
	 sexagesimal system used in clocks whose base 60 .

- The discovery of decimal Number System purely from India, when indian Mathematics purposes the concept of Place holder -

<font color="#9bbb59">Why do computer not Use Decimal Number System ?</font>
- The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), one of the earliest computers, actually used decimal representation instead of binary internally.
- This shows that decimal was the natural choice for early engineers too. 🖥️
- Later, the engineers realized that using decimals in computer systems was not convenient, as computers sometimes misinterpreted them and in the solution we found computer can works quite well with  <font color="#fbd5b5">Binary Number System</font> that is the reason we will still stuck on binary number system 

<font color="#9bbb59">Why Do Computers Use Octal and Hexadecimal Number Systems ?</font>
- Computers operate on Binary (Base-2) because their hardware (transistors) can only represent two states: ON (1) and OFF (0).
- binary numbers get long and hard to read for humans. So, to simplify
- Octal (Base-8) and Hexadecimal (Base-16) are used for grouping binary digits.
- This compact grouping allows easier reading, debugging, and memory address representation in computing.
- `Octal:` 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 digits we can represent `(000 -- 111)`
- `Hexadecimal:` 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 digits we can represent `(0000 -- 1111)`
