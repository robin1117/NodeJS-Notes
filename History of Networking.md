#Networking

The Internet evolved over decades through innovation, geopolitical pressures, and contributions from many researchers and engineers.
Till from ancients as human we always try to transfer messages fast enough from one place to another. Before the internet or Telephone were invented we had information as in physical form only.
So people at that time try every possible fast enough method like `Hourse`, `Pegion`, `etc`.

### 📞 Pre-Internet: The Telephone

When the Graham Bell invented the telephone it was just ground breaking at that time!  
**Alexander Graham Bell** invented the telephone, converting sound ↔ electrical signals.  
Laid the foundation for later electronic and long-distance digital communication.

### 🥷 1960s – The Cold War & ARPANET

When the cold war gets Started in 1960 between Russia and the USA the military of USA could`t` communicate efficiently. So -  
- Concerns about survivable communications during the Cold War led to research in resilient networks.  
- **1969:** **ARPANET** launched by the U.S. Department of Defense to connect 4 major research universities.  
- Introduced **packet switching**: breaking data into small packets for flexible routing and reliability.
#### 📡 Problem at the time
- Data exchange relied on physical media or voice calls; digital sharing was limited and inefficient.
#### 🔌 Solution
- Telephone lines and early networking allowed digital transfer between institutions.
#### 📝 First message
- The first ARPANET message attempted was **"LOGIN"** — only **"LO"** was received before a crash.

### 💻 1970s – Birth of TCP/IP

In next few years as the number of industries grown, these industries were also start making there own network protocol for there for Efficient communication.  
- Multiple incompatible networks existed because Multiple Organization was go to use there own different protocols.  
- So that **1974:** **Vint Cerf** and **Bob Kahn** proposed **TCP/IP**, a universal protocol suite enabling different networks to interoperate.  
- And later other Protocol was also camed like `SMTP`, `HTTP`, `FTP`.  
- So that all other Organization can able to rely on `Single Protocol`.

### 🌐 DNS

During the initial days Before the internet, we had to remember the IP of computer with that we want to connect, for that ARPANET maintains `host.txt` that contains Names for corresponding to each IP.  
Later the Engineer of `telnet` decided to integrate a system in `telnet` that converts `Name - IP`, this system is known as `DNS`.

Whenever you type something in your browser:
- **DNS Lookup** – Your computer asks the DNS system, *“Hey, what’s the IP for this domain?”*  
- **DNS Response** – The DNS sends back the matching IP address.  
- **Connection** – Your browser uses that IP to connect to the correct server.  
- **Website Loads** – You see the page you wanted.  

In short — DNS is the “middleman” that turns a name you understand into an address your computer understands.

### 🌏 World Wide Web - 1989

It was 1989, there was institute name CERN and they are Researching and sharing information using Network with other institutes. Over the time they notice there is a problem regarding sharing documents.

Researchers at CERN were facing difficulties in sharing documents efficiently.  
They couldn’t **directly jump from one document to another**, making collaboration and reference sharing hard.

As in Solution **Inventor:** Sir Tim Berners-Lee (a scientist at CERN, Switzerland) Proposes a Idea Hypertext.

- Tim Berners-Lee thought:  
- What if text could contain links to other documents or resources?  
- This idea led to the **invention of Hypertext** — a system that allows users to navigate between linked resources through text-based links.
#### 🤯Invention of the Web – 1990
Tim Berners-Lee didn’t just propose the idea — he **built the core tools** that form the foundation of the modern web.
#### 🧰 Key Tools Created by Tim Berners-Lee:
- **WorldWideWeb** – The first **web browser and editor**, capable of both creating and viewing web pages.  
- **info.cern.ch** – The **first web server** ever created.  
- **First Web Page** – Hosted on info.cern.ch, explaining _“What the Web is and how it works.”_
#### 👌The Three Core Components of the Web:
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** Used to structure and create web pages.  
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** The communication protocol that allows browsers and servers to exchange information.  
- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):** The unique address of any resource on the web.
#### 🌐 The Web Goes Public – 1991
In 1991, **CERN made the World Wide Web publicly accessible**.  
For the first time, **anyone with an internet connection** could:
- Create their own website  
- Access information hosted globally  

This was the **beginning of the public web**.

#### 🚀 Growth Explosion – 1993 to Mid-1990s
The early 1990s saw **massive growth** and innovation in the web ecosystem.
#### 🖼️ 1993 – The Launch of Mosaic

- Mosaic became the **first graphical web browser**.
- It made the web **visual and user-friendly**, introducing **images, layouts, and design** elements.
- This transition from text-only pages to graphical interfaces accelerated the web’s popularity.

#### 🌍 1994 and Beyond – The Web Revolution
The mid-90s brought a digital boom:

- 🔎 **Search Engines:** Yahoo (1994), Google (1998) made information discovery effortless.
- 🛒 **E-commerce:** Amazon and eBay introduced online shopping.
- 🎨 **Web Standards:** CSS (1996) and JavaScript (1995) enabled design and interactivity.
#### 📚 Summary
The **World Wide Web (WWW)** revolutionized the way humanity shares and accesses knowledge.
#### 🎯 Core Purpose:
To make information interconnected, easily accessible, and foster global collaboration.

#### 🧠 In Simple Terms:
**Web = Hypertext + Internet = World Wide Web (WWW)**

### 📱 2000s–Present – The Digital Age

- Rise of **broadband**, **Wi‑Fi**, **smartphones**, and mobile data.  
- Internet became integral to daily life—billions of connected devices and countless online services.

---
### 🧩 Summary

- Originated as a military research project for resilient communication.  
- Expanded through academic networks and standardization (TCP/IP).  
- Evolved into a global, commercial, and social infrastructure that powers modern life. 🌐✨
